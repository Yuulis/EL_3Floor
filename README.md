# EL_3Floor
Learning how to climb up to the 3rd floor.

Using [ML-Agents Release 17](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_17) and [NaughtyWaterBuoyancy](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyWaterBuoyancy).

## Environments
1. 3Floor_Lv1 : Simple three-story building.
2. 3Floor_Lv2 : Putting some obstacles in 3Floor_Lv1.
3. 3Floor_Lv4 : Putting some obstacles which close stairs in 3Floor_Lv1.

[!] I created 3Floor_Lv3 and Lv5, but these are for testing.
